# hello-world
My first depository on a path to a new data engineer/data scientist career.

I'm Egor, and I'm eager to develop my software engineering and data science skills.

I'm a dad of amazing triplets, and when I have free time (do I???) I love fooling around on a piano and reading biographies and historical fiction and non-fiction.
